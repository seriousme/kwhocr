# kWh OCR
This demo takes a photo (PNG format) of an electricity meter and tries to read the value of the meter.

Its based code I made for a friend in 2010 using [Processing](https://www.processing.org).
I decided to convert it to Javascript as its more easy to run in the browser.
(I also tried the original .pde with processing.js but that did not work)

The demo can be found [here](https://seriousme.github.io/kwhocr/).
